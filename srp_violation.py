    the class a module with more than one reason to change.

# Solution to violation: It is possible to divide the classes so that every module has only one actor. Then, a facade
# can delegate the calls of the classes containing the actual methods. Also, a different class is created to store the
# employee data. Obs.: Since this example is for study purposes, the methods are only instatiated as simple functions
# and not implemented. This can lead to the wrong idea that the solution consists in separating every method in a
# different class. However, it is worth mentioning that every task will probably contain different methods inside a real
# payment application.
